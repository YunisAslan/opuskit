# Sela Mor — Monochrome Minimal Personal Site

Sela Mor: Sound artist and composer from Baku: field recordings of wind, water and machines, turned into music for rooms, films and long nights. A personal site with a monochrome minimal direction: data sheet typography, a black box palette, typography leading the experience and immersive motion. Primary goal: get in touch.

This project is built from an OpusKit Universal Recipe. The recipe is the source of truth for design decisions — do not invent new colors, fonts, spacing or sections.

## Where things are
- `recipe/` — the design recipe, split by topic (read the relevant file before working on that topic)
- `assets/manifest.json` — every asset, its status (have / temporary / create / find) and usage
- `build/implementation-plan.md` — build order
- `build/verification.md` — definition of done
- `.claude/skills/` — visual-direction, responsive-design, visual-qa, motion-system, ui-components, performance

## The big idea — Chapters in giant words
Each part opens on one huge word; proof arrives one item at a time. Read it in `recipe/design.md` (“The Big Idea”) before building anything: every page serves it, and `recipe/design.md` ends with the award checklist every page must pass.

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Motion
- Lenis

## Non-negotiables
- Use tokens from `src/styles/tokens.css`; never raw hex in components.
- Fonts: Mona Sans (display), Mona Sans (body), Martian Mono (utility). Load with next/font.
- All media goes through `src/config/assets.ts`. Temporary assets stay replaceable.
- Every animation has a reduced-motion alternative.
- Ready code: `src/components/sections/` (one component per content section) and `src/components/pieces/` (your kit) are the starting structure. Pass real copy and media through props; change proportions and spacing to fit the recipe; never restyle them outside the tokens.
- Avoid: Accent colors on UI; Gradients; Too many type sizes.
- Video files must be prepared with `bash scripts/prepare-video.sh` before you touch any code. Never serve the raw upload — it is unoptimised, wrong shape, and missing the mobile and scroll variants. It sharpens a small source automatically (never pass `--no-upscale`); for people and real scenes use `--upscale footage`. Read its "Result:" line: desktop must be ≥ 1920 px wide and phone ≥ 1080 px tall. If it prints ⚠ instead, do not hide it — name it in your final reply as the one thing still to fix.

## How to work
- Build the complete site in one pass: every page, section and step in `build/implementation-plan.md`, in order. Do not stop between steps to ask for review, confirmation or permission to continue.
- Start by writing a short plan (5–8 lines: visual direction, hero, motion, how desktop and mobile differ), then implement immediately — do not wait for approval.
- After each step, check it against the `visual-qa` skill yourself and fix what fails before moving on.
- Only stop to ask when truly blocked: a required file is missing and the recipe gives no temporary option, or two recipe rules contradict each other.
- When finished: run the production build, fix every build and runtime error, check desktop (1440px) and mobile (390px) in a real browser, start the dev server and reply with the localhost URL and any temporary assets still to replace.
