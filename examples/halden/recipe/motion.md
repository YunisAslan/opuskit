## Motion System — Immersive

Pinned, scroll-driven sequences where media and type are choreographed together.

**Rule:** animation for demonstration, not decoration.

**Libraries:** CSS (transitions, scroll-driven animations), Motion, Lenis

### State feedback
- **Purpose:** Confirm interaction (hover, focus, press) so controls feel responsive.
- **Trigger:** Pointer hover, keyboard focus, active press
- **Behavior:** Color/underline/opacity change; no layout shift.
- **Duration:** 120–180ms
- **Easing:** ease-out
- **Implementation:** CSS transitions on color, opacity, transform.
- **Performance:** Transition only color, opacity, transform.
- **Reduced motion:** Keep — these are not motion-heavy; remove transform component.

### Clip reveal
- **Purpose:** Every section enters like a cut in a film — image first, words second.
- **Trigger:** Element enters viewport (IntersectionObserver, threshold 0.2), once
- **Behavior:** media unmask from a thin line to full height; text fades in after the media lands.
- **Duration:** 900–1200ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- **Implementation:** Motion `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`, or CSS + IntersectionObserver class toggle.
- **Performance:** Animate transform/opacity only; don't observe hundreds of nodes — observe section wrappers.
- **Reduced motion:** Opacity only, 200ms, no translate.

### Image clip reveal
- **Purpose:** Create a visual transition into the next section; the image "opens" like a curtain.
- **Trigger:** Viewport entry
- **Behavior:** clip-path: inset(100% 0 0 0) → inset(0); inner image scales 1.15 → 1.
- **Duration:** 900–1200ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- **Implementation:** CSS clip-path transition triggered by IntersectionObserver, or Motion useScroll + useTransform for a scroll-linked version.
- **Performance:** clip-path and transform are compositor-friendly in modern browsers; avoid animating width/height.
- **Reduced motion:** Simple 200ms fade.

### Line-by-line headline reveal
- **Purpose:** Direct attention to headlines and set reading pace.
- **Trigger:** Viewport entry, once
- **Behavior:** Each line masked (overflow hidden) and translated from 100% to 0, 80ms stagger.
- **Duration:** 700ms per line
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- **Implementation:** Split lines manually in markup (preferred for control) (one span per line or word); animate with Motion or CSS.
- **Performance:** Only transform; split into lines, not characters, for body-length text.
- **Reduced motion:** Show lines immediately.

### Smooth scroll
- **Purpose:** Make scroll-linked sequences feel continuous and cinematic.
- **Trigger:** Always on (desktop pointer devices)
- **Behavior:** Inertial scroll with lerp ~0.1; native scroll position preserved.
- **Duration:** Continuous
- **Easing:** lerp
- **Implementation:** Lenis (or the SmoothScroll kit piece); Motion useScroll reads the native scroll position Lenis keeps, so no extra syncing is needed.
- **Performance:** Disable on touch devices (native momentum is better); never break anchor links or keyboard scrolling.
- **Reduced motion:** Disable Lenis entirely.

### Pinned story sequence
- **Purpose:** Tell one story in steps while the visual stays in place.
- **Trigger:** Section reaches top of viewport; pinned for 200–400vh
- **Behavior:** Visual stays fixed while text chapters advance; media crossfades or transforms per chapter.
- **Duration:** Scroll-linked (scrub 0.5)
- **Easing:** linear scrub with eased keyframes
- **Implementation:** CSS position: sticky for the pin (a tall outer block, a 100svh sticky frame); Motion useScroll on the outer block → useTransform per chapter.
- **Performance:** Limit to one or two pinned sections per page; the outer block height is the pin length; test on mobile Safari.
- **Reduced motion:** Unpin: render chapters as a normal vertical list with static media.

### Scroll-scrubbed video
- **Purpose:** Let the visitor control time — scroll moves the camera through the scene.
- **Trigger:** Pinned hero section scroll progress
- **Behavior:** video.currentTime = progress × duration, smoothed (scrub 0.5).
- **Duration:** Scroll-linked over ~300vh
- **Easing:** linear scrub
- **Implementation:** Motion useScroll → useSpring → useMotionValueEvent sets currentTime; encode with scripts/prepare-video.sh (CRF 20, keyframe every 6 frames) from the original file — re-compressing a web copy is what makes scrubbed video look soft.
- **Performance:** Preload metadata + first chunk; use requestVideoFrameCallback where supported; mobile encode ≤ 3MB.
- **Reduced motion:** Show poster image; play video only on user request.

### Hover media preview
- **Purpose:** Let an index/list reveal the project image on hover, keeping lists compact.
- **Trigger:** Pointer enters list item (pointer devices only)
- **Behavior:** Image appears near cursor or in a fixed slot, crossfades between items.
- **Duration:** 250ms fade, 0.15 lerp follow
- **Easing:** ease-out
- **Implementation:** Motion (useSpring for cursor follow) — pointer:fine only.
- **Performance:** Preload preview images at small size; disable on touch.
- **Reduced motion:** Show image in fixed slot without follow motion.

### Page transition
- **Purpose:** Connect pages so navigation feels continuous (e.g. project thumbnail expands into the case study hero).
- **Trigger:** Route change
- **Behavior:** Shared element morphs between pages; others crossfade.
- **Duration:** 400–600ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- **Implementation:** View Transitions API (document.startViewTransition / Next.js experimental viewTransition) with CSS; Motion layout animations as fallback.
- **Performance:** Keep transitions short; never block navigation on animation.
- **Reduced motion:** Instant navigation.

## Signature Moments

None — this recipe keeps interaction deliberately quiet.

## Your Kit — ready pieces

The owner picked these components. Their code is already in the project at `src/components/pieces/` — it does the hard part (the animation, shader or interaction, and its reduced-motion version), so build on it rather than from scratch, and do not add other animation libraries for the same job. It reads colours and fonts from the recipe tokens (`--color-*`, `--font-*`). It is a reference, not a sealed part: keep what the owner picked it for — its behaviour — and fit everything else to the site (size, place, spacing, the type around it), editing its code wherever its defaults disagree.

### Smooth scroll — Whole site — mount once in app/layout.tsx
Scrolling glides instead of stepping, so every scroll effect moves as one.
- **Code:** `src/components/pieces/SmoothScroll.tsx` → `import { SmoothScroll } from '@/components/pieces/SmoothScroll'`
- **Use:** `// app/layout.tsx, inside <body>:
<SmoothScroll />`
- Mouse and trackpad only — touch keeps the phone’s own scroll.
- Never hijack the scroll: the page moves exactly as far as the visitor scrolls.

### Reading line — Whole site — mount once in app/layout.tsx
A hairline across the top fills as the visitor reads.
- **Code:** `src/components/pieces/ScrollProgress.tsx` → `import { ScrollProgress } from '@/components/pieces/ScrollProgress'`
- **Use:** `<ScrollProgress />`
- Long pages only (journal posts, case studies) — not the home page.
