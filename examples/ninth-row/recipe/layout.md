## Layout System — Full-bleed

The frame is already in `src/styles/tokens.css`: `--container`, `--gutter`, `--section-y`, `--ratio-card`, `--ratio-media` — every ready section uses them; new sections use them too, never a fixed max-width or padding. Each section's tone (ground, surface, inverse, chapter) and media placement are set per page below.

| | |
|---|---|
| Container | max-width 1200px, side gutter clamp(20px, 4vw, 40px) (--container, --gutter) |
| Grid | 12 columns for overlaid text |
| Columns | Overlay text in 5–6 columns at bottom-left; interstitial text centred in 8 |
| Gutters | clamp(20px, 4vw, 40px) (--gutter) |
| Section spacing | clamp(96px, 12vw, 160px) between sections (--section-y) |
| Alignment | Text anchored to bottom-left of media with safe-area padding |
| Hero composition | A pinned 100svh stage; the video's playhead is mapped to scroll progress over ~300vh. Type appears at chapter points. |
| Card proportions | 3:2 for project, product and people cards (--ratio-card) |
| Media proportions | 16:9 for pictures beside text (--ratio-media); 21:9 for a full-width band. Photo files follow the shot list (recipe/media.md) |

**Spacing scale (base 8px):** 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px, 128px, 160px, 240px. Inside a section use only values from the scale; between sections use --section-y. Space between sections is always larger than space within them.

### Shape — Sharp

Square corners, crisp lines — precise and editorial. Buttons 0px, cards 0px, media 0px, borders 1px, shadow none. No rounded corners anywhere; structure comes from lines and space.

### Menu — Centered logo

Logo in the middle, links split on either side — like a boutique.
- **Composition:** Symmetric bar: links left, logo centred, secondary links and the action right; generous height at the top that shrinks after scrolling.
- **Behavior:** Shrinks to a compact bar after 80px.
- **Responsive:** Mobile: centred logo, menu button left, action right.

## Home

Establish mood and promise in seconds; orient the visitor to what this site is and give them a clear next step.

### 01 Hero — Scroll-controlled video
- **Purpose:** Establish mood and promise immediately
- **Composition:** A pinned 100svh stage; the video's playhead is mapped to scroll progress over ~300vh. Type appears at chapter points.
- **Content:** One headline (≤ 8 words), one supporting line, one action
- **Behavior:** A sticky 100svh stage inside a ~300vh block; Motion useScroll on the block gives progress, smoothed with useSpring (stiffness ~120, damping ~30), and useMotionValueEvent sets video.currentTime. Encode with scripts/prepare-video.sh (CRF 20, keyframe every 6 frames) so seeking is instant and frames stay sharp.
- **Responsive:** Mobile: shorter scroll distance (~180vh), 9:16 encode, or fall back to an autoplaying loop + poster if seeking is janky on low-end devices.

### 02 Intro
- **Purpose:** Say what this is and who it is for
- **Composition:** Short statement in display face across 8 columns, with a small label
- **Content:** 1–2 sentences, specific and concrete
- **Behavior:** Line reveal
- **Responsive:** Scale statement to ~8vw; keep line breaks intentional
- **Design — Magazine opener (recommended):** The sentence large on the left, the paragraph low on the right. Pass `variant="split"`.
- **Reference code:** `src/components/sections/Statement.tsx` → `<StatementSection variant="split" label="Studio" statement="…" body="…" />` — its design to start from: real copy and media through props, `link={Link}` (next/link) for in-site links, tokens only; its sizes, spacing and type follow this site, and its code is edited wherever it disagrees.

### 03 Schedule
- **Purpose:** Show what happens when
- **Composition:** Days as columns (or stacked groups), each a list of time, title and a line of detail
- **Content:** Every day of the programme, real times, short titles
- **Behavior:** Static — no tabs, everything readable at once
- **Responsive:** Days stack, times stay left
- **Reference code:** `src/components/sections/Schedule.tsx` → `<ScheduleSection title="Programme" days={[{ label: "Friday", items: [{ time, title, detail }] }]} />` — its design to start from: real copy and media through props, `link={Link}` (next/link) for in-site links, tokens only; its sizes, spacing and type follow this site, and its code is edited wherever it disagrees.

### 04 Featured Work
- **Purpose:** Prove quality with 3–6 best projects
- **Composition:** The projects as its design says (below) — every project’s picture visible without hovering
- **Content:** Project title, discipline, year, 1 image each
- **Behavior:** Image reveal on entry; hover preview on index
- **Responsive:** Single column, images first
- **Design — One per row (recommended):** Each project full width, picture first. Pass `variant="stack"`.
- **Photos — Photo story (recommended):** Photo / text pairs that alternate sides on a 12-column grid; vary widths (7/5, then 5/7, then one full-bleed) so the rhythm never repeats twice in a row. Each pair reveals together; the photo may drift slightly slower than the text (≤ 8% parallax). Mobile: Stacks to photo-then-text; every photo full width; keep the original order.
- **Reference code:** `src/components/sections/FeaturedWork.tsx` → `<FeaturedWorkSection variant="stack" title="Selected work" projects={[{ title, meta, image, alt, href }]} />` — its design to start from: real copy and media through props, `link={Link}` (next/link) for in-site links, tokens only; its sizes, spacing and type follow this site, and its code is edited wherever it disagrees.

### 05 Newsletter
- **Purpose:** Turn a visit into a returning reader
- **Composition:** One reason to subscribe beside an email field and a button, with a note under it
- **Content:** What they get, how often, and that it is easy to leave
- **Behavior:** Static; the form posts to your email provider
- **Responsive:** Field and button stack, full width
- **Reference code:** `src/components/sections/Newsletter.tsx` → `<NewsletterSection title text placeholder="you@example.com" button="Subscribe" note="Once a month." action="https://…" />` — its design to start from: real copy and media through props, `link={Link}` (next/link) for in-site links, tokens only; its sizes, spacing and type follow this site, and its code is edited wherever it disagrees.
