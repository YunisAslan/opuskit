# Motion system — Dynamic

**Animation for demonstration, not decoration.** If an animation doesn't clarify content, hierarchy or story, don't add it.

Scroll-linked parallax, line-by-line type reveals, media transitions between sections.

Libraries: CSS (transitions, scroll-driven animations), Motion, React Three Fiber + drei. Use CSS for simple transitions, Motion for React UI animation, GSAP only for scroll-driven/pinned sequences.

## Patterns (implement in this order)
### State feedback
- Purpose: Confirm interaction (hover, focus, press) so controls feel responsive.
- Trigger: Pointer hover, keyboard focus, active press
- Behavior: Color/underline/opacity change; no layout shift.
- Duration / easing: 120–180ms · ease-out
- How: CSS transitions on color, opacity, transform.
- Performance: Transition only color, opacity, transform.
- Reduced motion: Keep — these are not motion-heavy; remove transform component.

### Fade & rise reveal
- Purpose: Give sections a calm entrance so content arrives in reading order.
- Trigger: Element enters viewport (IntersectionObserver, threshold 0.2), once
- Behavior: opacity 0→1, translateY 16px→0, children staggered 60ms.
- Duration / easing: 500–700ms · cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- How: Motion `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`, or CSS + IntersectionObserver class toggle.
- Performance: Animate transform/opacity only; don't observe hundreds of nodes — observe section wrappers.
- Reduced motion: Opacity only, 200ms, no translate.

### Line-by-line headline reveal
- Purpose: Direct attention to headlines and set reading pace.
- Trigger: Viewport entry, once
- Behavior: Each line masked (overflow hidden) and translated from 100% to 0, 80ms stagger.
- Duration / easing: 700ms per line · cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- How: Split lines manually in markup (preferred for control) or with GSAP SplitText; animate with Motion or CSS.
- Performance: Only transform; split into lines, not characters, for body-length text.
- Reduced motion: Show lines immediately.

### Parallax drift
- Purpose: Add depth so media feels like a space rather than a flat picture.
- Trigger: Scroll progress while element is in view
- Behavior: Media translates at 0.2–0.35× scroll speed within an overflow-hidden frame.
- Duration / easing: Scroll-linked · linear (scrub)
- How: CSS scroll-driven animations (animation-timeline: view()) with GSAP ScrollTrigger fallback for older browsers.
- Performance: Only transform; set will-change on the moving layer only while in view.
- Reduced motion: Disable parallax — static image.

### 3D pointer & scroll response
- Purpose: Invite exploration of the 3D object without demanding interaction.
- Trigger: Pointer move; scroll progress
- Behavior: Object rotates ≤ 8° toward pointer; camera dollies on scroll.
- Duration / easing: Damped (lerp 0.08) · damped spring
- How: React Three Fiber + drei; useFrame with damping; frameloop="demand" when idle.
- Performance: Cap DPR at 2, pause rendering off-screen, compress with Draco, lazy-load the canvas.
- Reduced motion: Static pre-rendered poster.

### Page transition
- Purpose: Connect pages so navigation feels continuous (e.g. project thumbnail expands into the case study hero).
- Trigger: Route change
- Behavior: Shared element morphs between pages; others crossfade.
- Duration / easing: 400–600ms · cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- How: View Transitions API (document.startViewTransition / Next.js experimental viewTransition) with CSS; Motion layout animations as fallback.
- Performance: Keep transitions short; never block navigation on animation.
- Reduced motion: Instant navigation.

## Rules
- Animate transform and opacity only.
- Wrap every effect in a reduced-motion check (`useReducedMotion()` or `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')`).
- Clean up ScrollTriggers / observers on unmount.
