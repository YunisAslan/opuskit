## Motion System — Dynamic

Scroll-linked parallax, line-by-line type reveals, media transitions between sections.

**Rule:** animation for demonstration, not decoration.

**Libraries:** CSS (transitions, scroll-driven animations), Motion, React Three Fiber + drei

### State feedback
- **Purpose:** Confirm interaction (hover, focus, press) so controls feel responsive.
- **Trigger:** Pointer hover, keyboard focus, active press
- **Behavior:** Color/underline/opacity change; no layout shift.
- **Duration:** 120–180ms
- **Easing:** ease-out
- **Implementation:** CSS transitions on color, opacity, transform.
- **Performance:** Transition only color, opacity, transform.
- **Reduced motion:** Keep — these are not motion-heavy; remove transform component.

### Fade & rise reveal
- **Purpose:** Give sections a calm entrance so content arrives in reading order.
- **Trigger:** Element enters viewport (IntersectionObserver, threshold 0.2), once
- **Behavior:** opacity 0→1, translateY 16px→0, children staggered 60ms.
- **Duration:** 500–700ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- **Implementation:** Motion `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`, or CSS + IntersectionObserver class toggle.
- **Performance:** Animate transform/opacity only; don't observe hundreds of nodes — observe section wrappers.
- **Reduced motion:** Opacity only, 200ms, no translate.

### Line-by-line headline reveal
- **Purpose:** Direct attention to headlines and set reading pace.
- **Trigger:** Viewport entry, once
- **Behavior:** Each line masked (overflow hidden) and translated from 100% to 0, 80ms stagger.
- **Duration:** 700ms per line
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- **Implementation:** Split lines manually in markup (preferred for control) or with GSAP SplitText; animate with Motion or CSS.
- **Performance:** Only transform; split into lines, not characters, for body-length text.
- **Reduced motion:** Show lines immediately.

### Parallax drift
- **Purpose:** Add depth so media feels like a space rather than a flat picture.
- **Trigger:** Scroll progress while element is in view
- **Behavior:** Media translates at 0.2–0.35× scroll speed within an overflow-hidden frame.
- **Duration:** Scroll-linked
- **Easing:** linear (scrub)
- **Implementation:** CSS scroll-driven animations (animation-timeline: view()) with GSAP ScrollTrigger fallback for older browsers.
- **Performance:** Only transform; set will-change on the moving layer only while in view.
- **Reduced motion:** Disable parallax — static image.

### 3D pointer & scroll response
- **Purpose:** Invite exploration of the 3D object without demanding interaction.
- **Trigger:** Pointer move; scroll progress
- **Behavior:** Object rotates ≤ 8° toward pointer; camera dollies on scroll.
- **Duration:** Damped (lerp 0.08)
- **Easing:** damped spring
- **Implementation:** React Three Fiber + drei; useFrame with damping; frameloop="demand" when idle.
- **Performance:** Cap DPR at 2, pause rendering off-screen, compress with Draco, lazy-load the canvas.
- **Reduced motion:** Static pre-rendered poster.

### Page transition
- **Purpose:** Connect pages so navigation feels continuous (e.g. project thumbnail expands into the case study hero).
- **Trigger:** Route change
- **Behavior:** Shared element morphs between pages; others crossfade.
- **Duration:** 400–600ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- **Implementation:** View Transitions API (document.startViewTransition / Next.js experimental viewTransition) with CSS; Motion layout animations as fallback.
- **Performance:** Keep transitions short; never block navigation on animation.
- **Reduced motion:** Instant navigation.
