## Layout System — Balanced

| | |
|---|---|
| Container | max-width 1200px, centred, 24px side padding (mobile 20px) |
| Grid | 12 columns |
| Columns | Text in 6–8 central columns; media spans 10–12 |
| Gutters | 24px (mobile 16px) |
| Section spacing | clamp(96px, 12vw, 160px) between sections |
| Alignment | Centred headings, left-aligned body text |
| Hero composition | Centred headline over or above a wide media block (16:9 or 21:9) |
| Card proportions | 4:5 for project/product cards, 3 per row desktop, 1 per row mobile |
| Media proportions | 16:9 wide, 4:5 portrait, 1:1 detail |

**Spacing scale (base 8px):** 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px, 128px, 160px, 240px. Use only values from the scale. Space between sections is always larger than space within them.

### Shape — Soft

Gently rounded corners — calm and friendly. Buttons 8px, cards 12px, media 12px, borders 1px, shadow none. Small, consistent radii; never mix sharp and rounded.

### Menu — Centered logo

Logo in the middle, links split on either side — like a boutique.
- **Composition:** Symmetric bar: links left, logo centred, secondary links and the action right; generous height at the top that shrinks after scrolling.
- **Behavior:** Shrinks to a compact bar after 80px.
- **Responsive:** Mobile: centred logo, menu button left, action right.
