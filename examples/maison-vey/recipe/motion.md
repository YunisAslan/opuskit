## Motion System — Subtle

Content eases in once as it enters the viewport; media drifts slightly. Nothing loops.

**Rule:** animation for demonstration, not decoration.

**Libraries:** CSS (transitions, scroll-driven animations), Motion

### State feedback
- **Purpose:** Confirm interaction (hover, focus, press) so controls feel responsive.
- **Trigger:** Pointer hover, keyboard focus, active press
- **Behavior:** Color/underline/opacity change; no layout shift.
- **Duration:** 120–180ms
- **Easing:** ease-out
- **Implementation:** CSS transitions on color, opacity, transform.
- **Performance:** Transition only color, opacity, transform.
- **Reduced motion:** Keep — these are not motion-heavy; remove transform component.

### Clip reveal
- **Purpose:** Sections open like turning a page — the frame first, then the words.
- **Trigger:** Element enters viewport (IntersectionObserver, threshold 0.2), once
- **Behavior:** blocks unmask upward: clip-path inset(100% 0 0 0) → inset(0); images settle from scale 1.06; text lines follow 70ms apart.
- **Duration:** 700–900ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- **Implementation:** Motion `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`, or CSS + IntersectionObserver class toggle.
- **Performance:** Animate transform/opacity only; don't observe hundreds of nodes — observe section wrappers.
- **Reduced motion:** Opacity only, 200ms, no translate.

### Image clip reveal
- **Purpose:** Create a visual transition into the next section; the image "opens" like a curtain.
- **Trigger:** Viewport entry
- **Behavior:** clip-path: inset(100% 0 0 0) → inset(0); inner image scales 1.15 → 1.
- **Duration:** 900–1200ms
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)
- **Implementation:** CSS clip-path transition triggered by IntersectionObserver, or Motion useScroll + useTransform for a scroll-linked version.
- **Performance:** clip-path and transform are compositor-friendly in modern browsers; avoid animating width/height.
- **Reduced motion:** Simple 200ms fade.

### Line-by-line headline reveal
- **Purpose:** Direct attention to headlines and set reading pace.
- **Trigger:** Viewport entry, once
- **Behavior:** Each line masked (overflow hidden) and translated from 100% to 0, 80ms stagger.
- **Duration:** 700ms per line
- **Easing:** cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- **Implementation:** Split lines manually in markup (preferred for control) (one span per line or word); animate with Motion or CSS.
- **Performance:** Only transform; split into lines, not characters, for body-length text.
- **Reduced motion:** Show lines immediately.

## Signature Moments

None — this recipe keeps interaction deliberately quiet.
