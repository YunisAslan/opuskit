## Layout System — Grid-driven

| | |
|---|---|
| Container | Full width, 24px margins; grid lines may be visible |
| Grid | 12 columns desktop, 6 tablet, 4 mobile |
| Columns | Modules snap to 3, 4, 6 or 12 columns |
| Gutters | 0 (bordered modules) or 16px |
| Section spacing | 96–128px, or sections separated by rules only |
| Alignment | Strict flush-left; numbers and labels in fixed column positions |
| Hero composition | A pinned 100svh stage; the video's playhead is mapped to scroll progress over ~300vh. Type appears at chapter points. |
| Card proportions | 1:1 or 4:5 modules, bordered, equal heights per row |
| Media proportions | 1:1, 4:3, 16:9 — always snapped to module width |

**Spacing scale (base 8px):** 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px, 128px, 160px, 240px. Use only values from the scale. Space between sections is always larger than space within them.

### Shape — Sharp

Square corners, crisp lines — precise and editorial. Buttons 0px, cards 0px, media 0px, borders 1px, shadow none. No rounded corners anywhere; structure comes from lines and space.

### Menu — Centered logo

Logo in the middle, links split on either side — like a boutique.
- **Composition:** Symmetric bar: links left, logo centred, secondary links and the action right; generous height at the top that shrinks after scrolling.
- **Behavior:** Shrinks to a compact bar after 80px.
- **Responsive:** Mobile: centred logo, menu button left, action right.
